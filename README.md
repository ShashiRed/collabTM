```

## Environment Setup

**Backend** (`backend/.env`)
```
PORT=5001
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:port/db
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
CLIENT_URL=https://collab-tm.vercel.app
```

**Frontend** (`frontend/.env`)
```
VITE_API_URL=https://collabtm.onrender.com/api/v1
```

## Deployment

**Backend** - Deployed on Render
- Automatic deployments from GitHub
- PostgreSQL database hosted on Render
- Environment variables configured in Render dashboard

**Frontend** - Deployed on Vercel
- Automatic deployments from GitHub
- Environment variable `VITE_API_URL` set in Vercel dashboard

## Running Locally

**Backend**
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npx prisma migrate dev
npm run dev
```

**Frontend**
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Real-Time Implementation

- `task:updated` → Broadcasts task changes
- `task:created` → Notifies all users of new tasks
- `task:deleted` → Syncs deletions across clients
- Notifications persisted in database and delivered via Socket.io

## Design Decisions

- **PostgreSQL + Prisma**: Strong relational integrity and type safety
- **HttpOnly cookies**: Secure JWT storage preventing XSS
- **React Query**: Server-state caching and optimistic updates
- **Socket.io**: Reliable bi-directional real-time communication
- **Clean architecture**: Separation of concerns for maintainability

## Testing

Unit tests cover:
- Authentication service logic
- Task creation and authorization
- Core business rules

Run tests:
```bash
cd backend
npm test
```
